Bio-transformers : Documentation and Tutorial
=============================================

bio-transformers is a python wrapper on top of the ESM/Protbert model,
which are Transformers protein language model, trained on millions on proteins and used to predict embeddings.
This package provide other functionalities (like compute the loglikelihood of a protein) or easily compute
embeddings on multiple-gpu.

Features
--------

Bio-transformers extends and simplifies workflows for manipulating amino acids sequences with Pytorch, and can be
used to test severals pre-trained transformers models without taking into account the synthax of different models.

Our development and all related work involved in the project is public,
and released under the Apache 2.0 license.

------------

Bip-transformers is a package belonging to the DeepChainBio repository, maintained by a team of
developers and researchers at Instadeep.
